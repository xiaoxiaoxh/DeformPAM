## üìÑ Introduction

### Key Idea
To quickly grasp the concept of DeformPAM, you may refer to [`predict()`](learning/net/primitive_diffusion.py#L1391) method in [learning.net.primitive_diffusion::PrimitiveDiffusion](learning/net/primitive_diffusion.py).

### Motivation

In long-horizon manipulation tasks, a probabilistic policy may encounter distribution shifts when imperfect policy fitting leads to unseen states. As time progresses, the deviation from the expert policy becomes more significant. Our framework employs Reward-guided Action Selection (RAS) to reassess sampled actions from the generative policy model, thereby improving overall performance.

</p>

### Method

![pipeline](assets/pipeline.png)

- In stage ‚ë†, we assign actions for execution and annotate auxiliary actions for supervised learning in a real-world environment and train a supervised primitive model based on Diffusion. Circles with the same numbers represent the manipulation positions for an action.
- In stage ‚ë°, we deploy this model in the environment to collect preference data composed of annotated and predicted actions. These data are used to train a DPO-finetuned model.
- During stage ‚ë¢ (inference), we utilize the supervised model to predict actions and employ an implicit reward model derived from two models for Reward-guided Action Selection (RAS). The action with the highest reward is regarded as the final prediction.

### Tasks and Hardware Setup

The following figure illustrates the object states and primitives of each task. Beginning with a random complex state of an object, multiple steps of action primitives are performed to gradually achieve the target state.

Here is the hardware setup and tools used in our real-world experiments. Devices and tools marked with DP are not used in primitive-based methods.

</p>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

### üß† Learning Environment

The learning code should work on environments that meet the following requirements:

- Modern Linux Distributions that are not in EOL.
- Python >= 3.8
- Pytorch >= 1.11.0
- CUDA >= 11.3

We recommend these combinations:

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Python = 3.8
- Pytorch = 1.11.0
- CUDA = 11.3

To setup the learning environment, you need to download and install CUDA from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) in advance. Then, you should run the `setup-env.sh` script to setup all basic requirments except for GroundedSAM.


```bash
bash setup-env.sh
```

This script will automatically create an conda environment named `DeformPAM` and install dependent packages in it. You can modify this script to make it behaves differently.

Finally, see [GroundedSAM](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything) for installation of Grounded-DINO and Segment-Anything.

### ü§ñ Real Environment

#### üì∑ Camera

Our project should work on any commercial 3D cameras systems that produce colorful point cloud and RGB images. However, for the best performance, we recommend high-precision and high-resolution 3D cameras. In our experiment, we adopt [Photoneo MotionCam3D M+](https://www.photoneo.com/products/motioncam-3d-m-plus/) and [Mech-Mind Mech-Eye LSR L](https://community.mech-mind.com/t/topic/2112) as the main 3D camera. However, if you are using custom cameras, please re-implement `get_obs()` method in [manipulation.experiment_real::ExperimentReal](manipulation/experiment_real.py#L408).

Please generate the calibration files and set the `CALIBRATION_PATH` in [Makefile](Makefile). You can take [tools/handeye_cali.py](handeye_cali.py) and [tools/find_world_transform_from_robot_cali.py](find_world_transform_from_robot_cali.py) for reference.

#### ü¶æ Robot

Our experiments are conducted using two [Flexiv Rizon 4](https://www.flexiv.cn/en/product/rizon) robot arms through [Flexiv RDK](https://rdk.flexiv.com/en/). Please re-implement [controller.robot_actuator::RobotActuator](controller/robot_actuator.py#L1), [controller.atom_controller::AtomController](controller/atom_controller.py#L8), and [controller.controller::Controller](controller/controller.py#L6), whether you are using Flexiv or custom robot arms .

### üì¶ Miscs

#### üîß Tools

Please refer to [tools/data_management/README.md](tools/data_management/README.md) for setting up the data management tools.

## üìï Usage

### üîç Inference

You can modify the [`TASK_TYPE`](Makefile#L3), [`SUPERVISED_MODEL_CKPT_PATH`](Makefile#L46), and [`TEST_MODEL_CKPT_PATH`](Makefile#L47) in [Makefile](Makefile) and run the following command to conduct inference on the real-world environment. The pre-trained models can be downloaded at [![Pretrained Models](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pretrained%20Models-FFD21E?logo=huggingface&logoColor=000)](https://huggingface.co/WendiChen/DeformPAM_PrimitiveDiffusion).

```bash
make test_real
```

### üìö Train Your Own Model

The training pipeline includes 2 stages, all wrapped as Makefile targets. You can download the data at [![Data](https://img.shields.io/badge/Data-FFD21E?logo=huggingface&logoColor=000)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WendiChen/DeformPAM_Dataset) or collect your own data according to the following instructions.

#### Stage 1 (Supervised Learning)

Set up the [`TASK_TYPE`](Makefile#L3) and [`TASK_VERSION`](Makefile#L6) in [Makefile](Makefile) and run the following commands:

```bash
# Stage 1.1: collect supervised data
make supervised.run_real
# Stage 1.2: annotate supervised data
make scripts.run_supervised_annotation
# Stage 1.3: train supervised model
make supervised.train_real
```

#### Stage 2 (Preference Learning)
Set up the [`SUPERVISED_MODEL_CKPT_PATH`](Makefile#L46) in [Makefile](Makefile) to the path of the trained model in stage 1. Then run the following commands:

```bash
# Stage 2.1: collect on-policy data
make finetune.run_real
# Stage 2.2: train preference model
make scripts.run_finetune_sort_annotation
# Stage 2.3: train DPO-finetuned model
make finetune.train_real
```
